Room 101's command system uses an [verb] [item] [modifier] [target] structure, meaning the first word of a command will be an action you wish to perform.  A few examples of verbs that are commands include 'move', 'look', 'examine', and 'eat'. [target] is the target of the verb, so in the case of "eat apple", 'eat' is the verb while 'apple' is the target. 

it is possible to execute more complete commands by supplying an [item] and a [modifier]. when using an [item] and a [modifier] you are indicating that you wish to perform [verb] on the [item] associated with [target]. For instance 'view stats of John Jones' is how you would view the core stats for a character named John Jones.
